# RogsTextAdventure_JS
The JavaScript Version!

Original remit:
Create a simple 80s style text adventure that runs in a console, then translate it into
as many console supporting languages as possible to show my flexibility and knowledge
of programming languages.

Originally done in VB .NET it was converted too:
- C#
- Delphi
- COBOL (!!)

As a tech demo it is currently limited to movement only via simple commands such as: move north
Required some utilities to be written especially for converting the level file into a COBOL
friendly format.

Why no C++ version? Well because C# is basically in many ways the same! (Might do it later on..)

This JavaScript version obviously does not run in a console so not technically meeting
the remit, but it was fun to do!

Background music and all other music was written and composed by me!
