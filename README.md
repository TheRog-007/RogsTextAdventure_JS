# RogsTextAdventure_JS
The JavaScript Version!
Potential employers who have seen my website know I initially did a basic 80s text style 
adventure game.

Originally done in Vb .NET it was converted too:
- C#
- Delphi
- COBOL
I thought a JavaScript version would be impossible due to JavaScript not being able to read
files from a PC.

However..

I have renctly finished a massively intensive course in JavaScript beginner to expert and I
now know how to do it!
